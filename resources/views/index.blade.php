            In most parts of Indonesia, nasi goreng is cooked with ample amounts of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce) that creates a golden brownish colour, and the flavour is mildly sweet.[4] A typical preparation of nasi goreng may involve stir frying rice in a small amount of cooking oil or margarine; seasoned with an ample amount of kecap manis and ground shrimp paste, and cooked with other ingredients, particularly eggs and chicken. However, in other places such as Eastern Indonesia (Sulawesi and Maluku), the sweet soy sauce is usually absent and is replaced by bottled tomato and chili sauce, creating reddish-coloured nasi goreng. This variant is called nasi goreng merah (red fried rice) or nasi goreng Makassar after the South Sulawesi capital. Some variants of nasi goreng, such as salted fish or teri Medan (Medan's anchovy) nasi goreng, do not use kecap manis at all, creating a lighter colour similar to Chinese fried rice or Japanese chahan.</p></div>

            Nasi goreng (English pronunciation: /ˌnɑːsi ɡɒˈrɛŋ/) refers to "fried rice" in both the Indonesian and Malay languages. Nasi goreng is often described outside of its region of origin, Maritime Southeast Asia, as an Indonesian rice dish cooked with pieces of meat and vegetables, although it is also endemic in several Malay-speaking communities within the region, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. It has gained popularity in Sri Lanka through historical migrations from the Malay Archipelago, in countries like Suriname via Indonesian immigrant communities, and in the Netherlands through its colonial ties with Indonesia.</p><br>
